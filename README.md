# Magisk builds

Topjohnwu already have canary build [here](https://github.com/topjohnwu/magisk_files/tree/master/canary_builds) [https://github.com/topjohnwu/magisk_files/blob/master/canary_builds/canary.json](https://github.com/topjohnwu/magisk_files/blob/master/canary_builds/canary.json). These are my personal Magisk builds (straight from topjohnwu's repo) as backup for johnwu canary build in case it hasn't been updated or i need custom magisk build.

You can subscribe to them by adding

[https://gitlab.com/xtrymind/magisk-files/raw/master/updater.json](https://gitlab.com/xtrymind/magisk-files/raw/master/updater.json)

as the custom update channel in Magisk settings. These are signed with my personal keystore so you will need to uninstall any versions of Magisk Manager you already have installed.

I do not provide changelogs, you can view the commits in [the Magisk repo](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/commits/master).

By running these builds, you accept you are running alpha software that is in constant development, for which there is no support. The official Magisk threads are for versions that topjohnwu has released himself; you should NOT request support for these builds in those thread. If there are any issues, please see the [unofficial builders thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/unofficial-magisk-v10-beta-built-t3521901) to see if it has been reported there already.
